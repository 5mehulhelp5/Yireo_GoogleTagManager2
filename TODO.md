# TODO
- Product attribute `item_category_2`
- Config key validation with fields `backend_model` (GTM-)
- Option to use RectorPHP to downgrade releases for PHP 7.3 compat

## Container export and import
See https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106997?hl=en
Possibly export the right container settings from the XML layout to upload into the GTM dashboard
